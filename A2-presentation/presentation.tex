    \frametitle{Technical Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Comprehensive Testing.} A conjunction of automated and
            manual testing by members of the development team and external
            testers. \emph{Product correctness} is guaranteed and verifiable.
        \item \textbf{Modular and Extensible.} Minimal programming is required
            to add new areas; on-boarding future development teams is trivial.
        \item \textbf{Numerous Vectors for Monetisation.} Modularity of the
            code-base encourages and actively supports the development of
            substantial extensions, such as additional areas in the form of
            downloadable content (DLC).
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Market Potential}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Attractive for Third-Party Commercialisation.} Easily
            swappable assets enable quick adoption of brand deals with third
            parties, such as universities, students' unions, and local public
            transport providers.
        \item \textbf{Continual Revenue Streams.} Character skins; in-game
            currencies; level bonuses: all likely mechanisms of creating stable
            cash-flow streams through \emph{micro-transactions}.
        \item \textbf{Strong Knowledge of the Player.} Substantial market
            research analysis was performed on a sample of the target audience:
            16-to-25-year-olds enrolling at an HE institution.
        \item \textbf{Inherently Cross-Platform.} Java and LibGDX provide proven
            stability across Windows, Mac, and Linux. The framework for mobile
            support is in place.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item All in-game assets are suitably licensed under permissive
            conditions for commercial use.
        \item Assets used are constituents of \emph{asset packs}: a consistent
            art-style can be maintained for any extensions.
        \item Any IP created by the \emph{\groupname} is under an exclusive
            licence to be used by the proprietors of \gamename.
